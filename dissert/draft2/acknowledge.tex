ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\

I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Andr\'e K\'ezdy, for near infinite patience, wise guidance, and steadying hand through the completion of this project.  I would also like to thank the other committee members; Dr. Thomas Riedel, Dr. Jake Wildstrom, Dr. Grzegorz Kubicki, and Dr. John Usher for their time, commitment, and valuable comments and suggestions.  I am also deeply indebted to the Department of Mathematics and the Logistics and Distribution Institute at the University of Louisville for their generous support.  Of course, a short note of acknowledgment could never encompass the gratitude I hold for my family;  my wife Sarah Caragianis and children Natalie and Preston for their patience and love, our parents Joan and George Caragianis and Rhonda and Isaac Tatum for everything they do and everything they are for us.    A final thank you to Dr. Cody Christopherson both for introducing me to productivity tools that helped me get across the finish line, and for being hilariously unproductive with me in high school.
