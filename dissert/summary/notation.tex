\subsection{Definitions}


\begin{mydef}
	A set of edges $F \subset E(G)$ is free iff $\forall e,f \in F$, $e$ and $f$ do not share an endpoint, and no endpoint of $e$ is adjacent to an endpoint of $f$.
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}
	A connected matching is a matching with no nontrivial free sets.
\end{mydef}

%\begin{mydef}
%	Let $G$ be a graph.  The free graph of $G$, denoted $F(G)$, is the graph on vertex set $E(G)$ with edge $\{u,v\}$ iff the corresponding edge set in $G$ is free.  IS THE HYPERGRAPH THE BETTER CHOICE?
%\end{mydef}

%\begin{mydef} If $F(G)$ is the free graph of some graph $G$ with $\alpha(G) \leq n$, then $F(G)$ is an $\alpha_n$-free graph.
%\end{mydef}

%\bguess{If $F$ is a path with 4 or more or a cycle with 5 or more vertices, then $F$ is not the free graph of any graph.}
