Say that a $B$ vertex $b$ {\it disrupts} an $A$ vertex $a$ if removing $b$ causes $a$ to be farther than 2 from some other vertex of $a$. A pair that $b$ does this to is a {\it disruption} induced by $b$.
\begin{prop}
	If $G$ has a connected matching saturating $A$, then for each $b\in B$, the collection of disruptions induced by $b$ has a non-empty intersection.   
\end{prop}
Call the vertex in this intersection the {\it disruption point} of $b$.
