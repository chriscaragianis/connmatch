	\item Complexity of chordal bipartite?
	\item Complexity of weakly chordal?
	\item Complexity of bipartite?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Consider reducing to 3sat via a gadget
		\item Phrase as a decision problem (Contains k-connected matching?)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Complexity of weakly chordal clique enumeration (remember self-complemetary!)
	\item Hall-type theorem for connected matchings in (chordal) bipartite graphs?
	\item Minimum edges induced by a k-connected matching?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item General graphs: ${k\choose 2} + k$ (attained by spider, holds in bipartite case with $k \leq 3$)
		\item Bipartite graphs
		\item Chordal bipartite (suspect nearly complete)

	\end{itemize}
	 
	 
\end{itemize}

With complexity problems, consider removing biclique edges (CBIP) or completing 2pairs (WC) an using a maximality argument
