\begin{document}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Let $G$ be a triangle free graph
	\item Label each edge near the endpoints with a $+$ or $-$
	\item We will assign $+$ or $-$ to each vertex and whenever this sign disagrees with an incident edge sign, delete the edge.
	\item Can we make the vertex assignment so that there is a large set of vertices inducing a bipartite graph?
\end{itemize}
