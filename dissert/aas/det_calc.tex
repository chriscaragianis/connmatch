Consider the RGB graph produced by the triangle free process.  Let $N$ be the random variable that counts the number of vertices in the RGB (edges in the underlying graph), and $R$, $G$, and $B$ the r.v.s counting the red, green and blue edges respectively.  Note that there is a one-to-one correspondence between red edges in the RGB graph and copies of $C_4$ in the underlying graph.

\noindent\textbf{Calculating $N$}

Bohman shows that a.a.s \[2^{-1/5}n^{3/2}\sqrt{\log n} < M < 161n^{3/2}\sqrt{\log n}  \]
