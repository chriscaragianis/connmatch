\begin{theorem}
For every pair of positive constants $\epsilon, c$ there is $n_{\epsilon, c}$ such that every triangle-free graph $G$ with $n > n_{\epsilon, c}$ vertices and $\alpha(G) < c\sqrt{n\log n}$ has fewer than $\epsilon n^3$ copies of $C_4$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Fix $\epsilon, c> 0$ and let $G$ be a triangle free graph on $n$ vertices with $\alpha(G) < c\sqrt{n\log n}$.  Let $X_{C_4}$ be the number of $C_4$ in $G$.  Then
\[X_{C_4} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\{u,v\}\notin E(G)} {|N(u) \cap N(v)| \choose 2}\]
Set $\epsilon_1 = \sqrt{8\epsilon}$ and suppose that there are more than $n^2(\log n)^{-2}$ pairs $u,v$ so that $|N(u)\cap N(v)| \geq \epsilon_1\sqrt{n}$. Then when we count the total number of vertices in these intersections, the count is at least $\epsilon_1n^{5/2}(\log n)^{-2}$, meaning some vertex is counted $\epsilon_1n^{3/2}(\log n)^{-2}$ times.  However, $\Delta(G) \leq \alpha(G) < c\sqrt{n\log n}$, so each vertex is in at most \[{c\sqrt{n\log n}\choose 2 } < \frac{c^2}{2}n\log n\] neighborhood intersections.  Thus, for sufficiently large $n$,  fewer than $n^2(\log n)^{-2}$ neighborhood intersections are larger than $\epsilon_1\sqrt{n}$.     

Now we can bound $X_{C_4}$.
\begin{eqnarray}X_{C_4} <& \frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{n^2}{(\log n)^2}{c\sqrt{n\log n}\choose 2}+ \left(|E(\overline{G})|- \frac{n^2}{(\log n)^2}\right){\epsilon_1\sqrt{n}\choose 2}\right]\\
\sim& \frac{\epsilon_1^2}{8}n^3 = \epsilon n^3
\end{eqnarray}
Thus for sufficiently large $n$, $X_{C_4} < \epsilon n^3$.
\end{proof}
